**Dataset Name: Student Facial Expression Recognition (SFER)**

**Description:**
The SFER dataset is designed to support research in facial expression analysis and emotion recognition in academic environments. The dataset comprises a diverse collection of facial images captured from students within the Computer Science department of the University Institute of Information Technology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan. It aims to reflect a broad spectrum of facial expressions and emotional states observed in real classroom settings.

**Features:**
- **Images:** High-quality images depicting a wide range of facial expressions.
- **Emotions:** Emotional states, including seven basic  happy, sad, angry, surprise, fear, disgust, and neutral.
- **Contextual Data:** Images collected from different classes and academic settings to ensure a representation of various emotional responses and focus levels.

**Purpose:**
The dataset is specifically curated to capture the nuances of student emotions and engagement during academic activities. By including images from multiple classes and educational contexts, the SFER dataset provides a comprehensive resource for understanding and analyzing student interactions and emotional responses in educational environments.

**Applications:**
- **Emotion Recognition:** Develop and validate models for accurate facial expression classification.
- **Educational Research:** Study the impact of emotional states on learning and classroom dynamics.
- **Human-Computer Interaction:** Enhance educational tools and virtual assistants with emotion recognition capabilities..

**Data Collection:**
Images were systematically collected from various classes within the PMAS- Arid Agriculture Rawalpindi, Pakistan, ensuring a representative sample of different emotional states in academic contexts. This deliberate approach ensures the dataset accurately reflects the diverse ways in which students express emotions and maintain focus.
